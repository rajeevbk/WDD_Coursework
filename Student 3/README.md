## Student 3 Task List
- [X] Your site should contain an interactive multiple choice quiz about the subject you are developing on your Web site. Once the quiz has been completed, it gives the user a mark on how he/she performed. This should be time limited. When the quiz is finished should also display the summary of the user performance (which answers were correct or incorrect, and how long it took to complete the quiz). The user will get 2 marks for each correct answer, and -1 for each wrong answer. The quiz should consist of 10 questions. The background colour of the page should change according to the awarded mark.
- [ ] Your main page should contain four pictures of the members of the group. When the user moves the mouse over one picture, the details of that member should be displayed in an area on the page (for example, you could use a div below the pictures). The details should include the name and role that that student took for the coursework (e.g. John Smith, Student 1).
