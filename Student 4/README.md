## Student 4 Task List
- [ ] Your site should contain a sitemap. The sitemap should have navigation links to the appropriate part of the group website, and should be developed in SVG.
- [ ] Create a page that allows the user to view images. This page contains a form, 5 thumbnail images, and 2 pull-down menus (to select the page background colour and the page text colour) and an area to display a larger image and associated description of that image. When the user selects a thumbnail image, the corresponding large image and the description of that image should display in the defined location on the form. You may use onMouseOver or radio buttons to select the thumbnail.
